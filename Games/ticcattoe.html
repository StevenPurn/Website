                <p>Tic Cat Toe was born out of the frustration of having starting and abadoned projects without finished any of them. </p>
                <p>We sat down with the objetive of designign a game which we could finish and release within a reasonable timeframe. 
                Obviously we also wanted to end up with a polished project at the end. I'm pretty happy with the results of this project but I
                 would like to potentially add in networked multiplayer at some point. It is something that should likely have been included 
                from the start of the project considering today's player expectations but we felt as thought it would add too much time to the development 
                cycle and compromise our original intentions.</p>
