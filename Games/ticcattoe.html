                <p>Tic Cat Toe was essentially the result of a few failed/abandoned projects which were highly over scoped for two relatively inexperienced people to make.</p>
                <p>We sat down and came up with what we thought would be a game that we could definitely finish and release within a reasonable timeframe. Obviously we also wanted to end up with a polished project at the end.</p>
