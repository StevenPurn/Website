                <a>Tic Cat Toe was essentially the result of a few failed/abandoned projects which were highly over scoped for two relatively inexperienced people to make.</a>
                <br />
                <br />
                <a>We sat down and came up with what we thought would be a game that we could definitely finish and release within a reasonable timeframe. Obviously we also wanted to end up with a polished project at the end.</a>
                <br />
                <br />
                <a>You can currently download Tic Cat Toe on Android & iOS.</a>
