                <p>Note: This is still a work in process so there isn't a tutorial and the numbers (speed/altitude/fuel) haven't been balanced yet.</p>
                <p>We started this project as a two person team trying to finish and publish our first game. 
                This is actually one of the abandoned projects that helped to inspire the push to make Tic Cat Toe.
                The basic idea is you're in a spaceship that has had some mechanical failures and you need to do
                 everything you can to prevent it from crash landing.</p>
                <p>As a player you've got to move between the rooms on the ship to put out fires, change the speed of the ship, 
                change the pitch of the ship, and keep your character healthy.</p>
                <p>The art for this game was done by <a href="yuriysivers.com">Yuriy Sivers</a>.</p>
